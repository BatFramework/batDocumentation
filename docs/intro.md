# Basics

## Getting Started

batFramework is available on Windows/Linux and only requires the pygame-ce library as a direct dependency.

### What you'll need

- Pygame-ce (install latest version using pip install):

- Python >=3.11


:::tip Quick Install
The following command will install batFramework and pygame-ce.
```bash
pip install --upgrade --pre batFramework
```
:::

## Your first project

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
